      and be bound to the Terms set forth below as they may be
      updated from time to time by SALT Insure Inc (“SALT”).</p>
    <p class="mb-4 font-semibold text-sm">YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SALT IS NOT AN INSURANCE CARRIER AND MAKES NO DECISIONS

                provision of these Terms (or have acted in a manner which shows that you do not intend to, or are unable
                to comply
                with the provisions of these Terms), (b) if SALT in its sole discretion believes it is required to do so
                by law
                (for example, where the provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or (c) immediately
                upon
                notice, to the e-mail address provided by you as part of your account information. We also reserve the

                <p class="mb-4">SALT makes no representations, warranties or guarantees, express or implied, regarding

                  Your access and
                  use of the Services may be interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons, including,
                  without
                  limitation, the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance or repair of the Services or
                  other
                  actions that SALT, in its sole discretion, may elect to take.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 font-semibold text-sm">UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL SALT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
                  USER ON ACCOUNT OF THE USE OR MISUSE OF AND
                  RELIANCE ON THE SERVICES (OR ANY CONTENT THEREIN). SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO PREVENT
                  RECOVERY OF
                  DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES (EVEN IF SALT
                  HAS BEEN
                  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES). SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY WHETHER THE
                  DAMAGES ARISE
                  FROM USE OR MISUSE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE SITE OR SERVICES, FROM INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, OR

                  SERVICES OR GOODS
                  RECEIVED THROUGH OR ADVERTISED ON THE SERVICES. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS, WAIVERS AND LIMITATIONS

                <p class="mb-4">The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the
                  bargain between SALT and
                  you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or
                  limitation of
                  liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>

                <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl font-raleway mt-8 mb-4">Indemnification</h1>
                  <p class="mb-4">You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless SALT and its subsidiaries and other

                    all
                    liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, that
                    arise from

                    deliberately or
                    as a result of your negligence) to the Services, (ii) your violation of any of these Terms, (iii)
                    any Content
                    provided by you through the Services. or (iv) any other activity related to your account (including
                    negligent or
                    wrongful conduct). SALT reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and
                    control of any
                    matter otherwise subject to defense by you, in which event you will cooperate with SALT and its
                    counsel in the
                    conduct of such defense.</p>

                  <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl font-raleway mt-8 mb-4">General</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
                      State of Texas, without regard
                      to its conflicts of law rules. You expressly agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim
                      or action arising
                      out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Service shall be filed only in the federal
                      courts located in
                      the State of Texas, or state courts located in Dallas County and you further agree and submit to
                      the exercise of
                      personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action. You
                      agree that
                      regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or
                      related to use of
                      the Services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action
                      arose or be
                      forever barred. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and SALT with respect to
                      the Services and
                      supersedes any other agreement, proposals and communications, written or oral, between SALT and
                      you with respect to
                      the subject matter hereof. If a court should find that one or more rights or provisions contained
                      in these Terms
                      are invalid, you agree that the remainder of the Terms shall be enforceable. SALT reserves the
                      right, in its sole
                      discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate the Services at any time, or modify these Terms
                      without notice.
                      Any changes to these Terms will be posted on the website and/or through the Services, and we will
                      try to provide
                      at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. By continuing to access or use the
                      Services after
                      those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
