    Independent insurance agents need to close more deals and grow their book of
    business. The problem is, too many agents are losing leads and customers
    every day because of their data collection methods. If you’re nodding your
    head, you may be feeling exhausted, burned out, and a little embarrassed. At
    SALT, we know there is a better way to feel proud of your process, increase
    your capacity, and grow your book of business. But first, let’s dive into
    the question at hand:
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">
    Why is your current data collection method losing you leads right now?
  </h2>
  <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-2">
    1. You’re still operating in a face-to-face mindset.
  </h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    If you’re used to gathering home and auto info the old-fashioned way —
    through in-person Q&A or lunch meetings — you’re most likely experiencing
    pain in this new era. Consumers want and need a convenient digital insurance
    application process, and if you don’t have a good system in place, you’ll be
    missing out on leads.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Self-reported data couldn’t be better timed given our current face-to-face
    restriction with social distancing measures. It also represents close to 60%
    time savings in your agency’s quoting process and a big leg up with E&O
    liability.

    2. You’re not offering a personalized online experience.
  </h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Afraid of what happens when consumers submit an insurance form alone? Your
    leads will not drop off if you offer a customized, personal experience. You
    shine as an independent agent because you’re there for your clients and you
    can guide them through the complexity of insurance. You need digital
    solutions that offer this same experience in the digital space.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Don’t worry! Guiding users through the insurance application and making
    complicated parts of insurance easy to understand is where SALT shines! Set
    your form up to give crucial coverage recommendations, advising your client
    in the places they need help the most.

    3. You haven’t shifted to a mobile-first mindset.
  </h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Companies that can’t make the shift to creating a mobile-first customer
    experience are
    <a
      href="https://www.airship.com/blog/customer-expectations-for-brands-on-digital-get-faster-better-smarter/"
      >increasingly at risk</a
    >. Over 70% of internet usage happens on mobile devices. Does your company
    have a way for people to submit an application from their sofa? When you can
    confidently point your leads to an easy to use form, as their very first
    step, you’ll convert more of your leads to customers.
