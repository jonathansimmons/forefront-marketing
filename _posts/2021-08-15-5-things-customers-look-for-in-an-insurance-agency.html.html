  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    If you’ve been in the insurance business for a while, the following
    statement should come as no surprise: The average customer and what they
    expect from an insurance agency has changed.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    As time moves on and customers evolve, you can’t expect to use the same
    customer service strategies that always have been go-tos for your agency.
    Your tactics have to evolve too.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    So what does the modern customer really look for when it comes to insurance?
    Here are five of the top things customers are looking for in an insurance
    agency:
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">1. 24/7 Availability</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    We don’t live in a 9-5 kind of world anymore. Anyone can look up
    information, access personal information or shop for anything at any time of
    day. The expectation that information and assistance are available at a
    moment’s notice extends to a person’s insurance needs too. Customers want to
    know that they can ask a live person or an automatic system to answer their
    questions or concerns at a moment’s notice, 24 hours a day, seven days a
    week.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">
    2. Automation and Interaction
  </h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    The internet has forever changed the way every industry does business, and
    that is certainly true for insurance. According to
    <a
      href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2015/08/25/379623.htm"
      class="text-teal-700"
      >Lynn Kesterson-Townes</a
    >, worldwide commerce marketing leader for IBM, you can learn a lot from how
    you interact with Millennials, people under the age of 30.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    While they grew up in a digital world and expect a certain level of
    automation—like being able to make payments or switch policies with a click
    of a button—they also want to know that live customer service is available
    to clarify information or give advice. While technology drives a lot of
    their action, so does the personal touch of customer service.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    At SALT, we know this is one of the biggest reasons why you as an agent need
    to
    <a href="https://insuranceform.app/sign-up" class="text-teal-700"
      >adapt your process to meet customer expectations</a
    >, and it’s why we created a solution.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">3. Simplicity</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Those in the insurance business know that it can get complicated pretty
    quickly. It takes years of training and tests and practice to feel confident
    that you know the ins and outs of the entire industry. But a customer
    doesn’t have years to get it right—their need is immediate.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Simplifying the process for customers is essential when it comes to keeping
    a customer both knowledgeable and comfortable. Offering customers an
    experience that doesn’t overwhelm them with information yet gives them peace
    of mind is the key to attracting customers that will be loyal to your
    agency.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">4. Empathy</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    After the initial buying experience, a customer usually interacts with an
    insurance agency when there has been a problem—an accident, a fire, a flood,
    a death. While facing what is probably one of the most stressful times of
    their life, a customer is looking for someone who knows their stuff but also
    empathizes with what the customer is going through.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    This starts with being a good listener and engaging the customer in a real
    conversation, showing genuine concern and interest in what they are going
    through. After all, insurance is purchased to give a customer peace of mind;
    peace of mind also should come during the claims process.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">5. Clarity and Value</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    While insurance can provide peace of mind, it also can be a hard sell since
    it’s something people may spend a lot of money on and never have to actually
    use. Customers need to feel that they are getting the most value for the
    best price. Always be clear about pricing and fees.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Using simple language and avoiding jargon is another way to be clear and
    communicate value to your customers. We had this in mind when designing
    SALT—agents can set up easy-to-understand coverage recommendations on their
    customized application form.
  </p>

  <hr class="bt-2" />

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Your prospective customers might be different than they would have been 30
    years ago, but it essentially all boils down to the same thing—they want
    convenience, and they want to feel like they are being taken care of.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
