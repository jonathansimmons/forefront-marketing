      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Objective</h3>
      <p class="text-xl mb-4">Mountain Springs Church is a vibrant community of faith in Colorado Springs, CO. Known for their outreach and stewardship, Mountain Springs has partnered with Fourfront for several years to create cinematic testimony pieces to use as part of their Easter services. In 2022, they proposed three potential subjects for the piece, and asked Fourfront to propose who was the right fit for the goals and theme.</p>

      <p class="text-xl mb-4">However, we also knew we needed to reduce the total budget by 25% relative to the 2021 piece, to support the church’s annual communication goals, while still producing something engaging and cinematic.</p>
