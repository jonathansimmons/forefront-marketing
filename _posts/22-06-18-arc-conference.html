      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Objective</h3>
      <p class="text-xl mb-4">Established in 2000, the Association of Related Churches is a cooperative of independent churches from different denominations, networks, and backgrounds who strategically resource church planters and pastors to help them reach people with the message of Jesus.</p>

      <p class="text-xl mb-4">Their annual ARC Conference is an expression of the organization’s mission, providing a forum for attendees to be resourced and build critical relationships with one another.</p>

      <p class="text-xl mb-4">ARC puts a special focus on making sure that these environments feel dynamic and inspiring for attendees, and has partnered with Fourfront since 2018 to help cultivate the atmosphere they’re looking to create.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-golden">Solution</h3>
      <p class="text-xl mb-4">Fourfront first worked on ARC Conference in 2018, delivering motion graphics pieces for social media as well as content for a large-format LED wall in the venue atrium.</p>

      <p class="text-xl mb-4">In 2019, we worked on a motion graphics package for both social media and a venue-specific LED screen array that included countdowns, openers, and more. Many of these pieces were repurposed for other iterations of ARC Conference in Los Angeles, Canada, Ireland, and South Africa. The event culminated in an “after party” where Fourfront created a 2-hour projection mapping installation across the venue’s external walls, with animation synced to a playlist selected by ARC.</p>

      <p class="text-xl mb-4">In 2021, the event returned from a pandemic hiatus to celebrate ARC’s twentieth anniversary.Fourfront created another motion graphics package to custom spec, as well as help plan a series of experiential and educational structures called “the ARC Experience” that walked through the organization’s past and present. Additionally, we were able to work on two more projection mapping installations that highlighted organization contributors with dynamic content projected onto dimensional elements.</p>

      <p class="text-xl mb-4">In 2022, Fourfront again delivered a motion graphics package and a projection mapping
        installation that helped engage attendees and reinforce the atmosphere ARC was looking to create.</p>
