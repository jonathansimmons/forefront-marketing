    Don’t get overwhelmed trying to think of everything that could go into your
    website. Too often, agents get lost in the design and forget about the
    function. To help you keep your eye on what matters most, we’ve compiled a
    list of elements your website should have to make sure you’re smashing your
    goals.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">The Call to Action Button</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    To put it simply, a call to action (CTA) is whatever you want the reader of
    your website to do. Want them to contact you? Request a quote? This would be
    your direct call to action.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    For potential customers, it’s important to make this call to action as
    prominent and easy to follow through on as possible. That’s why a clickable
    button in the top right corner of your website encouraging them to do that
    action is an important element in bringing in a potential customer through
    your website.

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">The Hero Banner</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    In web design, a hero banner is a bold, oversized image that draws the
    visitor’s attention immediately. A hero banner is important because it’s the
    first thing your potential customer will see when your page loads.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Since it’s the first thing they’ll see and notice, make sure your CTA is
    also included in the hero banner. When the image draws the eye, they will
    then be immediately called to contact you or request that quote you want to
    give them.\

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">Repeat, Repeat, Repeat</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Before your website visitor leaves the site, you want them to do something
    that will help them reach out to you as a possible lead in insurance sales.
    That means you have to repeat the call to action in multiple ways and in
    multiple places.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Have they missed the clickable button at the top of the page after
    scrolling? Give them another button to click further down the page as they
    read. Let them know multiple times in multiple ways to contact you so that
    they can easily provide you with their information.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">
    Find a Way to Collect Information
  </h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
