<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Everyone, insurance agent or not, wants the same things: new business, connecting with customers, and increased revenue.
For independent agents, these are even more challenging right now, as more and more people are hesitant to meet in
person and would prefer digital ways to do business.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">That might mean it’s time for you to find new ways to meet your audience where they are. We know, we know. You’d much
rather spend your time focused on your clients and potential customers – and rightfully so! But it doesn’t have to eat
up huge chunks of time to modernize your processes and stay ahead of the curve. The key is to find balance between the
small and big picture.</p>

<h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-2">Day-to-Day Operations</h2>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Finding the time to research new technologies is probably the biggest challenge when it comes to innovation. Nobody
wants to go through the legwork of adopting all these new technologies if it’s going to get in the way of their “actual”
work, like meeting with clients and actually helping people.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Still, the big picture will have to become at least something of a priority if you’re looking to evolve. You can start
by reviewing your current routine to see if there’s even a little bit of time you could spend researching new ways of
doing business.</p>

<h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-2">Think Bigger</h2>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">As you look into new apps and fancy software, always be asking yourself: Is this going to make my life easier. And if
so, how?</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A good entrepreneur aims to see things differently by implementing systems that improve efficiency without hindering
your daily work. Some examples of questions you should ask before committing to new programs are:</p>

<ul class="text-gray-700 list-disc mb-4 ml-8">
  <li>What problems does this solve for me and my team?</li>
  <li>Specifically, how does it solve those problems?</li>
  <li>How much work is this going to require to implement?</li>
  <li>Once that work is done, will it require even more work to keep this new program running?</li>
  <li>Will it be worth it?</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Instead of doing specific research, you could also get a demo of new products you’re considering. For example, <a class="text-teal-700 cursor-pointer" href="{{base_url}}/#virtual-demo">we can
show you how SALT can save you time and money firsthand.</a></p>

<h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 mb-2">Small Bites of Big Problems</h2>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Quick fixes are awesome; they’re quick and they fix things. What’s not to love? Sadly, many issues agents run into are
more complex and require more thought to solve. That’s why we recommend taking small bites, doing as much preparation as
possible beforehand to give you breathing room as you go.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Technology isn’t going to stop growing faster. The pace of your work and life in general are going to continue to
increase, and customers prioritize that speed. They want solutions remotely in a way that makes sense for them. For many
of the biggest companies that we consider “successful,” simplicity is one of the driving factors of their success.
Technology gives you that simplicity.</p>


<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 bg-gray-100 p-6 border border-gray-200 rounded-md flex flex-col">While many are hesitant to innovate in the insurance industry, those who adopt new technology first will come out ahead.
