    Let’s face it. When it comes to technology, the insurance industry has quite
    a bit of ground to make up. Even some of the ways agents have tried to
    innovate have often failed, but that doesn’t mean you should give up.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    The earliest adopters of new technologies usually have a massive advantage
    over those who wait, but adopting new tech takes time and energy. We know
    how exhausting it is to seek out new apps that, at least at first, eat up
    more time in your day – time you could be using to, you know, make contacts
    and sales.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Today, we’re here to share a few of our favorite productivity apps and tips
    for how to focus on what actually improves your day-to-day workload.
  </p>

    Favorite Productivity Apps for Insurance Agents
  </h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    There’s a good chance you already tried new ways to get the job done and it was terrible (or at least bad enough to make
    you not want to try again). We understand. As an independent agent, your priority is the customer, but you’re also
    trying to keep up with the industry.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    If you’re afraid to adopt new stuff, start small. Are you the type of person who 1) loves staying up to date with
    current trends but 2) doesn’t have time to sit around and read a bunch of articles? Try an app like <a class="text-teal-700" href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, which helps
    you collect to-read content and then read it at your leisure. You can even choose to listen to the article instead, if
    you’re more of a podcast fan.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Or if you just need to get more organized but you’re not looking to reinvent the wheel, try productivity apps like
    <a class="text-teal-700" href="https://todoist.com/"></a>Todoist</a> or <a class="text-teal-700" href="https://evernote.com/"></a>Evernote</a>. These apps centralize your schedule and information.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    For an independent agent looking to upgrade their application process, there’s <a class="text-teal-700" href="https://saltinsure.com">SALT</a>. Collect customer information
    online, streamline your process, and stop wasting time writing things down. With SALT, you get white-label, branded
    forms that you can customize with coverage recommendations and more.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Before committing to a new tool, try it out first. For example, with SALT, you can <a class="text-teal-700" href="https://saltinsure.com/demos">watch demos</a> and <a class="text-teal-700" href="https://demo.saltinsure.com">Start a free trial</a> before making any commitment.

  <h2 class="font-black text-xl mb-2">
    Replacing the Mundane
  </h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Since the first job in history, people have been doing tasks they hate alongside the work they’re actually passionate
    about. Things like gathering a customer’s basic information can eat up a ton of time and drain your energy along the
    way. As an independent agent, it’s likely you enjoy working with your clients and discussing problems with actual human
    beings much more than you like sifting through piles of handwritten notes and asking the same repetitive questions.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    The right tech replaces that drudgery. If you want to automate repetitive tasks and set up workflows for your business,
    check out <a class="text-teal-700" href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>. Zapier moves information between commonly used web apps automatically and is super handy.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    We know that in the insurance industry, you need to ask certain questions no matter who you’re talking to. It’s why we
    built <a class="text-teal-700" href="https://saltinsure.com">SALT to speed up and automate this process</a>, and to give you access to data in a centralized place.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-black text-xl mb-2">Capture More Opportunities</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    The right tools can help you scale your business. Customers expect things to be easy and when you remove friction from
    the process, you’ll win more customers. By offering a simple, branded online application form, you make the experience
    of working with you easier. Easier for them, and for you. We like to say that with SALT, you can accept applications
    while you sleep.
