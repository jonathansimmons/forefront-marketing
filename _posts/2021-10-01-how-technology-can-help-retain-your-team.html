    The insurance industry is, like most other industries, increasingly going
    digital as the world moves more and more online. According to a recent
    <a
      href="https://www.iamagazine.com/strategies/how-insurance-agents-are-using-technology"
      class="text-teal-700"
      >Providence Bank Agency Finance survey</a
    >, 86% of insurance agents agree that digital technology is vital to helping
    their insurance agency grow. However, 76% feel that they are not getting the
    most out of their digital technology.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Embracing technology as an insurance agency has more advantages than simply
    keeping up with the competition. Technology gives your team tools to make
    their jobs not only easier but more efficient. Here we show you the top
    three ways technology can help your team and make them want to stay with
    your agency.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">Technology Saves Agent Time</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Let’s face it - being an insurance agent comes with its fair amount of
    repetitive and manual tasks (read: paperwork, paperwork, paperwork) which
    takes you away from the thing you got into the field to do: selling
    insurance.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Technology can help you get back to that focus. By using technology to
    automate certain tasks like lead generation, application approvals, policy
    renewals, and all the data entry that these tasks involve, you’re not only
    making it more convenient for your customer by giving them access to your
    services at their fingertips, but you are saving yourself the time you would
    spend on data entry and paper pushing.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Automating the process puts you back where you belong: building customer
    relationships and communicating the values of your agency.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">
    Technology Improves Your Data
  </h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Data is the backbone of the insurance industry. However, it’s a fact of life
    that data in any system is only as good as the person who entered it. After
    all, that’s why Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance exists.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    To put it simply, when a human is inputting data, there are going to be
    errors. And in the insurance game, these errors could be costly to your
    agency. For example, just a simple misspelling of a name could cost an
    agency money, not to mention the loss of reputation in the community if they
    happen frequently.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Technology can help agencies avoid costly errors and maintain a good
    reputation all of which draws good agents to the team.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl mt-12 mb-2">
    Technology Brings You Up to Date
  </h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    You might not be a big international agency with thousands of team members,
    but you are now in a position where you have to compete with those who are.
    The best way to compete in the crowded marketplace is to give customers a
    lot of the amenities they have come to expect. In other words, you need to
    give customers easy and convenient access to their policies, their
    information, and their agent through technology.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    The days of having stacks of post-its on your desk with information to enter
    somewhere are over. The right technology will push your agency into the 21st
    century, making your agency someone who can compete with “the big dogs” and
    offer your customers the same level of satisfaction and convenience as
    everyone else.
