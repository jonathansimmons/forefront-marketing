          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4">
            <li>
              Phase one begins with discussing your goals, learning more about you and your organization. Then we review your budget, and identify priorities that support your vision and goals for that budgetary period. We close out phase one reviewing the nuts and bolts of an outsourcing workflow- legality, best practices, and fair expectations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Phase two kicks off with talking through potential solutions, accounting for scope and turnaround, based on the priorities identified in phase one. You'll get a clear understanding of action steps and likely outcomes, entirely custom to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Phase three is optional, but moves into a longer-term consultation as we help connect you to contractors and even help manage the workflow for you, serving as creative direction until you're comfortable. We can also vet potential contractors.

        <dd class="text-xl">Yep! We have people in our network who thrive in creative directorial roles, and come alongside your organization on either a retainer or per-project basis to help drive and bring it to life, in service of your vision and goals, with clear expectations and communication.</dd>

Reach out using the form above (can this scroll up to the form?) and we can talk through your budget, goals, and vision for what that hire would look like to help you through that decision-making process.</dd>

            <li>
              Phase one begins with a day with your team, getting to know everyone and discussing your current workflow. We also walk through a few activities together to inspire creativity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Phase two starts with delivery of a report with action steps that highlight specific recommendations to optimize your workflow specific to your goals. After six to eight weeks, we have a follow-up meeting to hear what's working, what's not, and what's next.

        <dd class="text-xl">Hi, <a href="http://twitter.com/friedriches" target="_blank" class="text-brand-golden">Andrew Friedrichs</a> here! I started fourfront in 2018 with a vision for helping to create greater access to sustainable creative for ministries, after almost a decade of working full-time as a creative professional at two local churches, a non-profit, and serving clients in the corporate sector. Today, we help more organizations in more contexts connect their vision to creative solutions with our network of artists and experts, and we get to make really cool stuff. My primary skills are in creative direction and project management, storytelling, and animating. I love experiential storytelling, college football, and custom mechanical keyboards.</dd>
